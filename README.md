# Real-time billionaires tracker

The richest 1 percent own nearly two-thirds of the world’s total wealth. And many fortunes continue to grow every day. The [realtimebillionaires.de](https://realtimebillionaires.de) website provides a deep insight into the wealth of the richest. It’s free, open-source and public.

All data on this website is based on Forbes’ real-time list of the world’s richest billionaires, which is updated daily and can be visited following [this link](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires). Historical net worth and ranking data was automatically imported and processed using archive.org. These values reach back until 2020.

Access and usage of the data provided on this website is free and unlimited through the GitHub repository [@komed3/rtb-api](https://github.com/komed3/rtb-api). There are also detailed instructions on how to retrieve data for custom projects. The repository is updated several times a year.
